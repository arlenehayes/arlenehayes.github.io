			<h3>A brief background</h3>
			<p>I hail from the lovely Grenada, an island in the Lesser Antilles of the
			Caribbean, where I attended school up to tertiary level at the local
			community college. I now attend the Illinois Institute of Technology in
			Chicago, Illinois after having gained two years of work experience at a
			design and construction firm back home in Grenada. I am currently pursuing 
			a professional Bachelor's degree in Architecture.</p>
			<p>By way of hobbies, I enjoy dance and the performing arts on a whole. I am a
			member of Conception Dance Theatre Grenada, a modern-, ballet- and Caribbean
			folk-oriented dance company.</p>
			<p>As a steadily maturing student of Architecture and dance, I would love to
			find a way to integrate the two and hence, I find myself greatly interested
			in Theatre Design.</p>
			<p>My long term goal is to develop myself as a designer and a project manager
			versatile in both design-build projects and stage art. Short term, I am 
			interested in intern positions with architecture and management firms in and 
			around Chicago to develop my skills and work ethic. I am also seeking 
			opportunities to study abroad where I can experience new cultures
			and come away with a greater appreciation of world architecture and art 
			practices.</p>
